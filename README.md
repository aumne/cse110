In the words of many a program:

I'm Diego Alfaro, a third-year undergrad double majoring in computer science and linguistics at UCSD.

## Me As a Programmer
Whether for an assignment or for something small and personal, I've programmed in the following languages at least twice:
- Java
- C
- C++
- Python
- ~~Scratch~~ ;)

Ranked list of programming languages I used once and never want to again:
1. ARM asssembly

Assembly wins by default here, but I'm sure it would still win even if there were more things listed. Working with something low level like assembly made me glad I wasn't born over a generation ago. Moreover, it made me realize C was never actually *that bad*, something I tend to forget whenever I see the helpful and incredibly descriptive error message `Segmentation fault`.

Some things I've learned or haven't (yet) learned to do:
- [x] Quit vim
- [ ] Get a program right on the first try

I'm not even sure if that last thing is even **possible**.
